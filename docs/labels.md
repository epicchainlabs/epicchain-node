# Project-specific labels

## Component

We have a set of compiled binaries which also enclose a subset of functionality
(there are overlaps for internal components, but those are OK), so they
naturally form this set of labels:

- neofs-adm
- neofs-cli
- neofs-ir
- neofs-lens
- neofs-storage

## Platform

We don't yet support anything but Linux. We at the same time are likely to
support Mac/Win in the future and historically one label was always here:

- windows
  
  It won't be easy, so it deserves a label of its own.
